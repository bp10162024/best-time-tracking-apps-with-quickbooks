                    <p>What is time tracking? Why is it important? And which time tracking apps work best with QuickBooks®?</p>
                    <p>In this post, I’ll be answering those questions and more.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, you’ll come away knowing which time-tracking apps are best for tracking time spent on various tasks (of course), but in addition, you’ll learn which apps also:</p>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li>Improve workflows</li>
                        <li>Help control finances</li>
                        <li>Measure productivity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mb-4">Using a time-tracking application day to day  is important for many reasons</h2>
                    <h3>No. 1: Time-tracking apps show when (and where) employees work</h3>
                    <p>PTO, sick days, client meetings—all these time tracking entries take an employee out of the office, yet they’d obviously be billed differently.</p>
                    <p>But as we all know, <b>being absent from the office doesn’t mean you’re not working.</b></p>
                    <p>Easy-to-use time-tracking apps (like the list we’ve supplied below) allow employees to track their time on the go and let managers keep track of the status of their teams.</p>
                    <h3>No. 2: Time-tracking apps measure employee productivity</h3>
                    <p>At first glance, “measuring employee productivity” makes time trackers seem like a micromanagement dream.</p>
                    <p>But that’s not what we’re advocating here. In fact, <b>measuring a project’s progress using a time-tracking application lets employers check in without “checking in.”</b></p>
                    <p>It also makes it simpler for managers to identify project complexities, since it visualizes where employees may be struggling. This (we hope) gives employers the justification for a larger training budget or even a workflow reset.</p>
                    <p><b>Time trackers help start the “How could this process be improved?” conversation.</b></p>
                    <h3>No. 3: Time-tracking apps help estimate project costs and provide accurate and transparent pricing for clients.</h3>
                    <p>Clients want to see exactly how much time their service provider spends on their project.</p>
                    <p>And service providers, like accountants, government contractors, electricians, etc., also benefit by getting accurate job costing estimates for how long a similar project will take the next time.</p>
                    <p>Clients are happier because time allocation is transparent throughout the project’s term. (Zero unexpected costs.) Job costing estimates improve in accuracy over time.</p>
                    <p>Zero question of compensation; the evidence for where time was spent is visible throughout the project’s term.</p>
                    <h2 class="mb-4">The best time-tracking apps for businesses using QuickBooks</h2>
                    <p>It’s easy to control finances with a time-tracking app. It’s not as easy to select from the many feature-rich applications on the market today.</p>
                    <p>To help you find the right app for your business, we’ve put together a brief list of consumers’ favorite time-tracking apps below. Full disclosure: These are all apps that Rightworks hosts—although that isn’t the reason we created this post. We’re just lucky enough to host some of the best applications in the business market!</p>
                    <h3>No. 1: Buddy Punch</h3>

                    <h3 class="mb-4">No. 2: BigTime</h3>
                    <figure>

                    <h3 class="mb-4">No. 3: Hour Timesheet</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/images/hour_timesheet.png" class="img-fluid w-100" alt="Image">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Hour Timesheet wants to be known for one thing: DCAA (Defense Contract Audit Agency) compliance. And in a probably too-simplistic nutshell, the DCAA works to ensure contracted entities use government funds appropriately.</p>
                    <p>If/when the agency audits a contractor, that contractor’s employer must be able to furnish evidence that they spent X amount of time on Y project.</p>
                    <p>Hour Timesheet provides that important DCAA-compliant evidence with its simple, customizable time-keeping solution.</p>
